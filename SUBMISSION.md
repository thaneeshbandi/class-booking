## Notes for the reviewer

<Anything we should know before opening the link — e.g. your host sleeps when idle and the first
request can take up to a minute.>

## Stack

| Layer | What you used | Why |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| Frontend | Not built yet | See `docs/architecture.md` — deliberately deferred until the server-side goals it depends on were done and tested |
| Backend | Node.js, Express, Knex (query builder + migrations) over `pg` | See `docs/decisions.md` |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 (Docker locally; not yet deployed) | See `docs/schema.md` |
| Hosting | Not deployed yet | No frontend exists yet to deploy alongside the backend |

## Goal checklist

Mark each honestly. Partial is fine — say what is partial.

| # | Goal | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Accounts and roles | Done | Server-enforced staff/instructor split throughout; see `docs/architecture.md` |
| 2 | Classes | Done | Create/edit/archive/restore |
| 3 | Sessions inside classes | Done | Create/edit/delete with server-side room/instructor conflict detection |
| 4 | Booking lifecycle | Done | Full state machine, session-lock concurrency protocol, FIFO waitlist promotion, immutable history; see `docs/decisions.md` and `docs/architecture.md` |
| 5 | Co-instructors | Done | Staff-only add/remove; instructor sees own-sessions list (primary + co-instructor) |
| 6 | Booking search/filter/sort/pagination | Done | `GET /api/bookings` — text search (name/email), class/session/status filters, a whitelisted sort, page/pageSize pagination, and a total count, all in one authorized SQL query; see `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/decisions.md` |
| 7 | Recurring schedule + CSV export | Not done | |
| 8 | Dashboard | Not done | |
| 9 | Immutable booking history | Done | Delivered as part of goal 4 — append-only `booking_events`, enforced by trigger and (optionally) revoked grants |
| 10 | Expiring membership alerts | Not done | The supporting table (`member_alert_dismissals`) exists in the schema; no endpoint yet |
